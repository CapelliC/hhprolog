# HitchHiker Prolog in FPC (Free Pascal Compiler / Lazarus)

Recently I had an experience porting from Delphi to FPC, and Pascal has been
interesting to learn. And the Lazarus IDE is quite a pleasure to use,
with just a few of rough spots, mainly during debugging.

--------

Ported to Free Pascal from C++.
Performance still to be evaluated.

Most data structures have been adapted from Generics.
The recursive data structure used for term interfacing has been redesigned
and a little optimized.
